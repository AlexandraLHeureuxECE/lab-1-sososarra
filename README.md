## SE4471B - Lab 1: Tic Tac Toe

## Web-Based Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built as part of **SE4471 – Lab 1 (Vibe Coding)**.  
The goal of the lab was to explore LLM-assisted software development by building a small application and documenting how the solution evolved through interactions with a large language model.

The game allows two players to take turns on the same device, provides clear game feedback, and includes enhanced visual cues for improved user experience.


## Features

- Interactive 3×3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid
- Turn-based gameplay for two players
- Win and draw detection
- Clear status messages indicating turns and outcomes
- Restart game button (no page refresh required)
- Enhanced visual feedback:
  - Highlighted winning combinations
  - Disabled board after game completion
  - Hover effects for interactive cells
- Clean and modern user interface

## LLM Tool Disclosure

This project was developed using LLM-assisted coding.
LLM Tool Used:
ChatGPT
How it was used:
ChatGPT was used to generate the initial Tic-Tac-Toe implementation, refine game logic and status feedback, enhance visual UI elements, and iteratively improve the application based on testing and evaluation.
